    "title": "Challenge",
    "description": "The Cool Out website faces several challenges. Age verification for THC products must be implemented smoothly to comply with legal regulations, which can create friction in the purchasing process. Additionally, shipping restrictions due to varying state laws may limit delivery options, potentially frustrating customers. The site must also ensure scalability to handle high traffic and maintain fast loading times, preventing high bounce rates. Educating customers about the benefits of THC-infused seltzers is key to building trust in an emerging market, requiring clear product descriptions and FAQs. Finally, ensuring secure payment processing for cannabis-related transactions is critical to avoid legal and financial complications."
