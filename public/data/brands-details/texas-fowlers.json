    "title": "Challenge",
    "description": "One key challenge for Texas Fowlers is the intense competition in the outdoor gear market, where larger brands like Cabela's and Bass Pro Shops dominate, making it difficult for smaller retailers to capture significant market share. Additionally, the user experience could be an issue, as the extensive product catalog may overwhelm customers, highlighting the need for a more streamlined and intuitive shopping experience. Lastly, increasing brand visibility and attracting new customers presents a challenge, as Texas Fowlers would require a robust and targeted online marketing strategy to stand out in a crowded and competitive market."
